## Hi there 👋

I'm a passionate **Front-End Developer** with a strong focus on building clean, user-friendly web interfaces.  
My experience is mostly centered around two areas I really enjoy:

- 🖥️ **Website development**: from crafting responsive layouts and adding smooth animations to integrating JavaScript logic and customizing WordPress themes/plugins to fit real business needs.
- ⚛️ **React application development**: from building new apps from scratch *(my favorite part!)* to improving and maintaining existing ones by fixing bugs and delivering new features.

I love turning ideas into working solutions, collaborating with teams, and constantly learning something new.  

Currently based in **Canada 🇨🇦** and open to exciting opportunities!
